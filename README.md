# Introduction to solving Optimization Problems using Python
I am exploring python as an alternative to MS Excel for doing simple optimization problems. I mainly focus on linear optimization

I am using Windows 10 OS. So far I have found scipy and pulp as reasonable packages to use. See references for a few good articles on each.
## Set up
I used the [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install) as my base Python library.
You then need to install these two libraries:
1. Pulp (main optimization library)
> pip install pulp
2. seaborn (for graphing)
> conda install seaborn
